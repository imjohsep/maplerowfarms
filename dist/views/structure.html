<div class="icr-styles-view-media-queries"> <div class="icr-main-content"> <h2>Structure</h2> <p>Figuring out where styles live and play their part works like this.</p> <hr> <h3>Common Styles</h3> <p>The common folder holds directives, scripts, styles and html that is used throughout multiple Angular Apps in the codebase. We're just going to focus on the shared Sass. Let's break down some of the files.</p> <p>In <span class="code-snippet">common/src/shared_modules/main/styles</span> let's look at <span class="code-snippet">_base-classes.sass</span></p> <div class="icr-style-component-code"> <code ascii> %-icr-main-link# =background: none# =text-decoration: none# =cursor: pointer# </code> </div> <p><span class="code-snippet">%</span> are placeholders. They are not rendered in the compiled css file until it is <span class="code-snippet">@extended</span> in a class. Beyond placeholders you can see in the file that this is the basis on many styles throughout our angular apps. When you see classes that start with the naming prefix of <span class="code-snippet">icr-main</span> will always mean that the class is originating in <span class="code-snippet">_classes.sass</span> and possibly pulling on placeholders in <span class="code-snippet">_base-classes.sass</span></p> <p>Remember that common styles cascade into all angular apps. You should always test your styles extensively in different context before bumping a class into Common. Additionally, when a class is bumped into the Common folder, you should strip any app specific styles. This might include positioning and service specific colors.</p> <hr> <h3>Breakdown of sass contents</h3> <ul class="icr-main-list"> <li><span class="code-snippet">_classes.sass</span> is used for component classes used across multiple views.</li> <li><span class="code-snippet">_styles.sass</span> is used for layout classes</li> <li><span class="code-snippet">_mixin.sass</span> is used for none component specific classes. So mixins used in multiple classes. If making a mixin that would be a component, simply keep it in the <span class="code-snippet">_classes.sass</span> file.</li> <li><span class="code-snippet">_icons-merged</span> is legacy classes for <span class="code-snippet">grunt-iconizr</span> that started having dependency problems on the creator's end.</li> <li><span class="code-snippet">_resets.sass</span> are classes that will reset browser settings. Most of this should be taken care of in Common.</li> <li><span class="code-snippet">_variables.sass</span> while most variables like colors will already be set in Common, you may set additional variable in specific apps.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3>Angular App Sass Structure and Prefixing</h3> <p>Let's cover file structure first; using Advantage-Signup as an example. Most HTML views will always have a corresponding Sass file.</p> <p><img src="/images/file-structure.png"></p> <p>Each HTML view has a corresponding Sass file so that we can use prefixing to target elements easier. In the HTML there is a wrapper div around the view's content that has both the prefixing of the app <span class="code-snippet">icr-adv-signup</span> followed by <span class="code-snippet">-view</span> and then the name of the view, <span class="code-snippet">member-details</span>.</p> <p><img src="/images/html-image.png"></p> <p><img src="/images/sass-image.png"></p> <p>You can see in the Sass how easy it is to add custom styling and positioning to global styles such as <span class="code-snippet">.icr-main-button</span>. By prefixing each view correctly, we can rest assured that style conflicts are avoided.</p> </div> </div>
